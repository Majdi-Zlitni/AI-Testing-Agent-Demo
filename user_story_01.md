### Test Case: Sort Products from High to Low Price

**Goal:** As a user, I want to sort the products by price and verify the sorting is correct.

**Test Steps:**

1.  Log in to `https://www.saucedemo.com` using the username `standard_user` and password `secret_sauce`.
2.  Once on the inventory page, find the product sorting dropdown menu that has a class product_sort_container.
3.  Change the sorting order to "Price (high to low)".
4.  After sorting, verify that the first item listed is the "Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket", which is the most expensive item.
5.  Log out of the application.
